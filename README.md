# Data Analyst Portfolio — Yusuf Abdiqadir

Three compact projects to showcase **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** skills.

## Projects
1. `excel-employee-salary/` — Excel pay calculator + dashboard (formulas, PivotTables, slicers).
2. `sql-retail-queries/` — 20–25 SQL queries answering business questions (joins, aggregates, CTEs).
3. `powerbi-revenue/` — 3-page Power BI dashboard (KPIs, Region/Product drilldown, YoY).

Each folder has a README with steps and deliverables. Add screenshots and short insights as you finish.
